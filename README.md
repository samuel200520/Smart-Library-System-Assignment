# Smart-Library-System-Assignment
Perfect  here’s a **clear, student-friendly `README.md` file** for your Smart Library Management System project.
It includes the setup guide, usage instructions, and how to run your demo and test files.

# Smart Library Management System (Python)

#Project Overview

This is a simple **Smart Library Management System** written in Python.
It allows you to manage books and members — add, search, borrow, return, and delete records — all from the terminal.

The project demonstrates basic CRUD operations, modular programming, and dictionary-based data storage.

# Requirements
Before running the project, make sure you have the following:

 Python 3.8 or higher
   A code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, or any IDE)
  The following files saved in the same folder:

   `operations.py` → contains all the functions (add, search, borrow, etc.)
   `demo.py` → shows how the system works step-by-step
  (optional)`test_operations.py` → for automated testing



# How to Run the Project

# Clone or Download the Repository

If you’re using GitHub, open your terminal and run:
bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/smart-library.git
cd smart-library
Or just download the ZIP file and extract it on your computer.


# Run the Demo File
The demo file (`demo.py`) shows the Smart Library system in action.
bash
python demo.py
You’ll see outputs like:
Book added successfully!
Member registered.
Borrow operation successful.
Search by author 'George': [{'isbn': '444', 'title': '1984', ...}]

# Run Individual Functions (Optional)

If you want to test specific features interactively:
bash
python

Then inside the Python shell:
python
from operations import *
add_book("777", "Data Science 101", "Jane Doe", "Education", 2)
search_book("Data Science")

# Run Tests (Optional)

If you have a `test_operations.py` file with assertions:
bash
python test_operations.py

Would you like me to now create the **Rational.md** file next (explaining your project purpose, design, and structure)?
